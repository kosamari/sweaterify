## FAQ
### Why did you make Sweaterify ?
I have a home-use programmable knitting machine from 80s. I've been working on software to design pattern for this machine. If you are curious checkout talks I gave below.

 - [Once upon a punch card - how textiles can explain why we have the web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7wwuZnnM9k)

### Can I use Sweaterify to design knit pattern, cross stitch, or bead weaving?
Yes ! Once you are happy with the design, click on `Download Pattern CSV`, it will give you pattern guide in CSV format.

### Can I buy a sweater designed using Sweaterify ?
That is extremely unlikely. It takes me about a week to make a sweater (even with the help of home-use knitting machine) which means it would cost a lot to make one. That being said, if you are working on special project & need custom knitwear produced, [please get in touch](https://twitter.com/kosamari)
